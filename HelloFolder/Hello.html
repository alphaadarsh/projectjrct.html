        About Me
I’m Adarsh Pandey, a 17-year-old student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) from IGNOU. I have a deep interest in cybersecurity, which fuels my curiosity about how systems work and how they can be protected from threats. Although I’m currently exploring web development due to certain circumstances, my passion for cybersecurity remains strong and continues to guide my learning path.

I consider myself a fast and self-driven learner, always ready to take on new challenges and adapt to evolving technologies. I’ve also been awarded a scholarship to the University of the People, a respected online university based in California, USA, which reflects my dedication and potential in the field of computer science.

Beyond academics, I actively engage in improving my technical skills, especially in areas like networking, ethical hacking, and programming, while also focusing on English communication to prepare for professional environments. I believe in self-growth, consistency, and smart work, and I’m constantly working toward becoming a skilled professional in the field of cybersecurity and technology.
